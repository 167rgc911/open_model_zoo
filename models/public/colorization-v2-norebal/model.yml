    The `colorization-v2-norebal` model is one of the [colorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511)
    group of models designed to perform image colorization. For details
    about this family of models, check out the [repository](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization).

    The gray-scale or BGR image should be converted to LAB color space first.
    The model input is a blob that consists of a L-channel of image of 1x1x224x224.
    The mean values need to be subtracted as follows: 50.0
    before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided
    by 255.

    The model output is a blob that consists of AB channels of image of 1x2x56x56.
