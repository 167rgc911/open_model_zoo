# ssd300

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The "ssd300" model is a a [Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf) network intended to perform face detection. This model is implemented using the Caffe framework. For details about this model, check out the [repository](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x3x300x300" in BGR order.

The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as previously described.

## Performance

## Input

Image, shape - `1,3,300,300`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`

## Output

The net outputs a blob with shape: [1, 1, N, 7], where N is the number of detected
bounding boxes. For each detection, the description has the format:
[`image_id`, `label`, `conf`, `x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`],
where:

- `image_id` - ID of the image in the batch
- `label` - predicted class ID
- `conf` - confidence for the predicted class
- (`x_min`, `y_min`) - coordinates of the top left bounding box corner (coordinates stored in normalized format, in range [0, 1])
- (`x_max`, `y_max`) - coordinates of the bottom right bounding box corner  (coordinates stored in normalized format, in range [0, 1])
