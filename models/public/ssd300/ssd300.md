# ssd300

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The "ssd300" model is a a [Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf) network intended to perform face detection. This model is implemented using the Caffe framework. For details about this model, check out the [repository](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x3x300x300" in BGR order.

The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as previously described.
